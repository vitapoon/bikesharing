## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the project was to use data from New York City's Citi Bike program and see if it would be possible to recreate the program in De Moines, Iowa. In order to complete this analysis, I used Python's pandas library to clean up the data and then created visualizations of that data using Tableau.

## Results:
Throughout this analysis I wanted to answer the following questions:

1,Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

2,Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

3,Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

To answer these questions I came up with the following visualizations.

## Check out time for user
